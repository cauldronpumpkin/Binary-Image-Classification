# Binary-Image-Classification
Binary Image Classification to decipher between Horses and Humans.
The Dataset can be found on kaggle.com
I have made use of augmentation of images to better train the CNN model.
The Accuracy was in the range (.92-.94).

# Instructions
It is encouraged to run the code in Google Colab as the ram required is large (around 17 GB).
Comments have been added near train data directory and test data directory to identifiy them.
Directory mentioned above is the one which contains the folders 'horses' and 'humans'.
The only part of the code you have to change is the path of train and test data. Other operations like normalisation and reshape will be performed automatically.
